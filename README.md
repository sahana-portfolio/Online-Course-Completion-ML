# Online Course Completion Prediction

This project predicts whether a student will complete an online course using machine learning.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset**: Online course student activity and demographics (target: `completed_course`, binary)
- **Goal**: Predict course completion and analyze key factors.
- **Algorithm Used**: Logistic Regression
- **Language & Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Key Steps
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Handling missing values  
3. Feature engineering (BMI, engagement score)  
4. Encoding categorical variables  
5. Feature scaling  
6. Model training and evaluation  
7. Visualization: Confusion Matrix and Top Feature Importance  

## Results
- Built a predictive model to classify student course completion.
- Visualized performance with a confusion matrix.
- Identified top factors influencing completion.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository  
2. Open `Online_Course_Completion_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run all cells sequentially
